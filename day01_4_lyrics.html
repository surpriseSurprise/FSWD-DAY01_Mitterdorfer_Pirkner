	<br>
	<span>
		<P>I used to rule the world </P>
		<P>Seas would rise when I gave the word</P>
		<P>Now in the morning, I sleep alone</P>
		<P>Sweep the streets I used to own</P>
		<P>I used to roll the dice</P>
	</span>
<br>
	<span>
		<P>I used to roll the dice</P>
		<P>Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes</P>
		<P>Listen as the crowd would sing</P>
		<P>Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!</P>
	</span>
<br>
	<span>
		<P>One minute I held the key</P>
	<P>Next the walls were closed on me</P>
	<P>And I discovered that my castles stand</P>
	<P>Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand</P>
	</span>
<br>
	<span>
		<P>I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing</P>
	<P>Roman Cavalry choirs are singing</P>
	<P>Be my mirror, my sword and shield</P>
	<P>My missionaries in a foreign field</P>
	<P>For some reason I can't explain</P>
	<P>Once you go there was never, never a honest word</P>
	<P>And that was when I ruled the world</P>
	</span>
<br>
	<span>
	<P>It was a wicked and wild wind</P>
	<P>Blew down the doors to let me in</P>
	<P>Shattered windows and the sound of drums</P>
	<P>Peopleâ€¦</P>
